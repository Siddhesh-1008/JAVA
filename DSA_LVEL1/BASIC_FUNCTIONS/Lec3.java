SUMMARY
TIP:-FOR CONVERTING DECIMAL TO ANY BASE NUMBER WE NEED TO CONTINUOUSLY DIVIDE THE NUMBER BY BASE NUMBER AND WHAT WILL BE THE REMAINDER JUST REVERSE IT 
    o	IF WE OBSERVED CLEARLY THERE IS A QUOTIENT AND REAMINDER PATTERN PRESENT
    o	WE HAD USE WHILE LOOP AND THIS LOOP WILL RUN UNTIL QUOTIENT DOESNâ€™T GETS EQUL TO ZERO
    o	THEN DO MODULUS OF NUMBER AND STORE THE LAST DIGIT IN DIG AND THEN MULTIPLY THE DIG WITH INCREASE POWER(THAT IS 10^POWER)
    o	MEANS
          o	FOR FIRST REMAINDER IT IS 2 THEN 2 *10^0
          o	FOR SECOND REMAINDER IT IS 7 THEN 7 *10^1
          o	FOR THIRD REMAINDER IT IS 1 THEN 1 *10^2
          o	FOR FOURTH REMAINDER IT IS 1 THEN 1 *10^3
          o	FOR FIFTH REMAINDER IT IS 0 THEN 0 *10^0
    o	AND NOW JUST ADD ALL REMAINDER*POWER AND THEN RETURN THE VALUE
