      * ðŸ“Œ SUMMARY: PRIME FACTORIZATION
      * This program prints the prime factorization of a given number.
      *
      * âœ… HOW IT WORKS:
      * 1. Start dividing the input number `n` from 2 (smallest prime).
      * 2. If `n` is divisible by the current divisor `div`, print it and divide `n` by `div`.
      * 3. Keep dividing by the same `div` until it no longer divides `n`.
      * 4. Then increase `div` to check for the next possible prime factor.
      * 5. Loop continues while div*div <= n (we donâ€™t need to check beyond âˆšn).
      * 6. If after the loop, `n` is still > 1, it means `n` itself is a prime number 
      *    and should be printed (this handles cases like 13, 17, 29, etc).

    * ðŸ§  Example:
    * Input: 60
    * Output: 2 2 3 5
    * (Because 60 = 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 5)

        for (int div = 2; div <= Math.sqrt(number); div++) {

            // IF BELOW LOOP !=0 THEN INCREMENT DIV BY 1
            while (number % div == 0) {
                // TO REDUCE QUOTEINT
                number = number / div;
                System.out.print(div + " ");
            }
