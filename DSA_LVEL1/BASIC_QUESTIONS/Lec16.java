 * ðŸ“Œ SUMMARY:
            * This program calculates the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and LCM (Least Common Multiple)
            * of two given numbers using the Euclidean Algorithm.
            
            * âœ… STEPS:
            * 1. Take two numbers as input.
            * 2. Store the original values for LCM calculation.
            * 3. Use a loop to apply Euclidean Algorithm:
            *    - Divide the larger number by the smaller one.
            *    - Save the remainder.
            *    - Replace the larger number with the smaller one.
            *    - Replace the smaller one with the remainder.
            *    - Repeat until remainder becomes 0.
            * 4. The last non-zero number is the GCD.
            * 5. Use the formula: LCM = (original_n1 * original_n2) / GCD
            * 6. Print both GCD and LCM.
            
            * ðŸ§  Tip:
            * - GCD helps find common factors.
            * - LCM helps find a common multiple for timing or syncing problems.
