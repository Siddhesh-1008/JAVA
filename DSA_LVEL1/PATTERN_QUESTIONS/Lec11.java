          ðŸ“Œ How It Works:
          Input:
              The user enters the number of rows (total_rows) for the triangle.

          Variables:
              num starts at 1 and keeps increasing with each number printed.

          Outer Loop (i):
              Runs from 1 to total_rows
              Each iteration represents a new row in the triangle.

          Inner Loop (j):
              Runs from 1 to i (number of columns increases with each row)
              Prints the current value of num, then increments it.

          ðŸ§± Pattern Shape:
              Forms a right-angled triangle aligned to the left.  
              Numbers increase sequentially from top to bottom, left to right.
